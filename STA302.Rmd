# Week 1

## Agenda for today:

- Introductions 
- Relations between Variables
- Correlation = Causation ?
- Linear Regression
- Gauss Markov Assumptions

## Introductions

Ice Breakers -- Your name, Program of study, What is the one thing that you are looking forward to about covid-19 restrictions being lifted? What is the thing you are currently dreading about it?

## Relations between variables

### Functional Relationships

We can think of functional relationships as the highest law on how two variables behave. Suppose $$ Y = f(X) $$ where $X$ is the independent variable and $Y$ is the dependent variable. The function $f$ here denotes the relation between the two variables. Lets consider the relation between dollar sales $(Y)$ of a product sold at a fixed price and number of units sold $(X)$. If the selling price is $\$2$ per unit, the relation is expressed by the equation:

$$ Y = 2X $$ 

This is an example of functional relationship, as there is no uncertainty involved. You give an input, and always have an output. Lets look at a graph of this example to better understand what we mean. 

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, include=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

# Generate some constants for X and Y
X=c(75, 25, 130)
Y=c(150, 50, 260)

# pass that into a data frame object
data<-data.frame(X, Y)

# Use ggplot to plot our X and Y
ggplot(data,aes(x=X, y=Y))+geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method='lm',col="red", formula=y~x)

```

Note that all observations lie on the line of a functional relationship, i.e the relationship is 1 to 1. 

### Statistical Relationships

A statistical relationship is a relationship between two or more variables where not all points fall on the line, and the relationship is not 1-1. A statistical relationship contains some form of randomness which is denoted by $\epsilon$ and associates with the statistical model. 

Suppose Performance evaluations for 10 employees were obtained at midyear and at year-end are defined as: 

$$ Y = \beta X + \epsilon $$
Note that this model encompasses of both a functional and statistical relationship


$$ Y = \underbrace{\beta X}_\text{Functional component} + \underbrace{\epsilon}_\text{Statistical component} $$ 

We should also note that there are two characteristics of a statistical relationship: 

- Tendency of Y to vary with X (direction)
- Random scatter around this tendency (strength)

### Correlation VS Causation

Correlation *does not* mean Causation

In regression analysis, we are only looking at the association, or co-relation of the independent and dependent variables. This does not imply causation of Y due to X. To actually build causation models, is a very niche topic and one that is still developing and being worked on to this day. (Hint: It is not easy to detect causation)

Here is a funny little chart which illustrates how correlation doesn't mean causation.

## 

The goal of this section is to list all topics covered in this weeks lecture, and then go through the ones students feel they need more clarification on. 

- Population
- Experimental / Observational Unit
- Sample 
- Statistic
- Statistical Inference

## R basics - Part I

The plan today is to cover lots of R basics, so you can see what R is capable of and learn these concepts on your own. In this section, we will cover reading data into R, using R console as a Calculator, Variables, Comments, Vectors, and different types of data frames in R.

### Using R as a Calculator

We can preform basic mathematic operations in R, just like you would on any normal calculator. <br> Note that the hashtag symbol (#) is a comment and anything after that line in R is not read in as code. 

```{r, include = TRUE}
# Addition 
3+3
# Subtraction
219-9
# Multiplication
50*2
# Division
1000/2
# Exponents
10^2
# Order of Operations still applies here
(2+2)*4
```

```{r, include = TRUE}
# Special numbers
pi
exp(1)
```

### Variables

We can also store these results using an assignment operator into a variable, and use those variables going further. 

```{r, include = TRUE}
# Assignment Operator is the = sign, or <- 
# Statisticians usually use <- for naming variables
x <- 2+2
x
y <- 10
x*y

# We can also name our variables, use them as necessary
my_name <- "Tahir"
cat("Hi, nice to meet you all! -", my_name)
```

### Data Types

There are different types of data in R. <br>
The ones we have seen above are integer, double (numbers with decimals), and char (defined by quotations).<br> Below is a table with some examples of each data type.<br>

![Different Data Types in R](images/Week1/Datatypes.png)
\vspace{12pt}<br>

We can check the certain types of our variables using the is.<data type> command, where datatype is replaced by one of the data types mentioned above. See some examples below. 

```{r, include=TRUE}
name <- "Tahir"
is.integer(name)
is.character(name)
```

# Week 2

### Vectors

Vectors are one of the most simplest data structures in R. <br>
You can make an vector by grouping some values of the same data type together with c(), which combines the single elements into a vector. <br>

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Basic vector operation
x <- c(1,4,6,-8,5)
# Adding an element to a vector
x+y
# Multiplying by a scalar to vector y
x*y

# Methods on vectors
mean(x)
var(x)
sd(x)
var(x)
median(x)
sum(x)
prod(x) 
```
