# Week 1

## Agenda for today:

- Introductions 
- Vocabulary Review
- R basics 

## Introductions

Ice Breakers -- Your name, Program of study, one thing that you absolutely love / or one thing that you absolutely hate about quarantine

## Vocabulary Review

The goal of this section is to list all topics covered in this weeks lecture, and then go through the ones students feel they need more clarification on. 

- Population
- Experimental / Observational Unit
- Sample 
- Statistic
- Statistical Inference

## R basics - Part I

The plan today is to cover lots of R basics, so you can see what R is capable of and learn these concepts on your own. In this section, we will cover reading data into R, using R console as a Calculator, Variables, Comments, Vectors, and different types of data frames in R.

### Using R as a Calculator

We can preform basic mathematic operations in R, just like you would on any normal calculator. <br> Note that the hashtag symbol (#) is a comment and anything after that line in R is not read in as code. 

```{r, include = TRUE}
# Addition 
3+3
# Subtraction
219-9
# Multiplication
50*2
# Division
1000/2
# Exponents
10^2
# Order of Operations still applies here
(2+2)*4
```

```{r, include = TRUE}
# Special numbers
pi
exp(1)
```

### Variables

We can also store these results using an assignment operator into a variable, and use those variables going further. 

```{r, include = TRUE}
# Assignment Operator is the = sign, or <- 
# Statisticians usually use <- for naming variables
x <- 2+2
x
y <- 10
x*y

# We can also name our variables, use them as necessary
my_name <- "Tahir"
cat("Hi, nice to meet you all! -", my_name)
```

### Data Types

There are different types of data in R. <br>
The ones we have seen above are integer, double (numbers with decimals), and char (defined by quotations).<br> Below is a table with some examples of each data type.<br>

\vspace{12pt}<br>

We can check the certain types of our variables using the is.<data type> command, where datatype is replaced by one of the data types mentioned above. See some examples below. 

```{r, include=TRUE}
name <- "Tahir"
is.integer(name)
is.character(name)
```

# Week 2

### Vectors

Vectors are one of the most simplest data structures in R. <br>
You can make an vector by grouping some values of the same data type together with c(), which combines the single elements into a vector. <br>

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Basic vector operation
x <- c(1,4,6,-8,5)
# Adding an element to a vector
x+y
# Multiplying by a scalar to vector y
x*y

# Methods on vectors
mean(x)
var(x)
sd(x)
var(x)
median(x)
sum(x)
prod(x) 
```
